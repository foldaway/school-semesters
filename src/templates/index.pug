    p This repository allows the generation of school terms.
    p Academic calendars usually reside in PDF files, which is a great visual format but not ideal for data processing. The code here does not attempt to parse PDF files, but rather tries to mimic the logic used to set school terms (e.g. 2nd Sunday of August).
